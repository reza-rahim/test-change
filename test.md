# Microservice Framework - Mesos/Marathon, Docker, Weave and Flocker

1. **Docker:** Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux.
2. **Mesos:** Apache Mesos is a centralised fault-tolerant cluster manager. It’s designed for distributed computing environments to provide resource isolation and management across a cluster of slave nodes.<br>
  A Mesos cluster is made up of four major components:
  1. **ZooKeepers**
  2. **Mesos masters**
  3. **Mesos slaves**
  4. **Frameworks**
